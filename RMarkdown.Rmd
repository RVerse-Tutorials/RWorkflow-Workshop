## Overview

Rmarkdown is a format that allows you to combine text and R code.  From RStudio you can output your file in many formats: html, PDF, Word, presentations.

## Copy the Rmarkdown folder from GitHub

### Method #1

1. From RStudio, go to the menu option
'File->New Project...'. Then from the resulting dialog, choose
"Version Control".  Then choose "Git".  Then it asks for a "repository URL".
Supply this: `https://github.com/RVerse-Tutorials/Rmarkdown-Tutorial` and 
leave the "Project Directory Name" empty.  And then choose a directory 
in which to put it and click OK.

2. Click on the 'More' link in the Git Window of RStudio, and click 'Shell'.  Then issue this command.
```
git remote rm origin
```
This detaches the cloned repository from the remote repository on GitHub from where you cloned it.
That will pull the RStudio project off of GitHub, make a local clone
of it on your hard drive and open.

### Method #2

If that doesn't work, then go to https://github.com/RVerse-Tutorials/Rmarkdown-Tutorial and click 'Clone or download' and chose 'Download Zip'.  If you chose, 'Clone in Desktop', you'll need to run the git code above to detach from GitHub.

### Add your new Project to your GitHub (optional)

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Click File > Add Local Repository
3. Navigate to the folder `Rmarkdown-Tutorial` and click Add Repository
4. Now you should see 'Publish Repository' in GitHub Desktop.  Uncheck the 'keep code private box' and then click 'Publish'.  Note, it can take a moment to work.


## Create documents in different formats

### HTML

### Word

### PDF

### Presentations


## Put your report online

### RPubs

After knitting your Rmd file, a Preview will appear.  Click the 'Publish' button in the top right, select 'RPubs'.  This is a free service for publishing output.  Follow the instructions and you'll soon have a link you can share.

### GitHub

If you have made your folder a Git repository, you can upload you html file to GitHub and share a link.  We will cover that when we talk about websites on GitHub.
