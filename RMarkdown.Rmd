## Overview

R Markdown is a format that allows you to combine text and R code.  From RStudio you can output your file in many formats: html, PDF, Word, presentations.  We are exploring a small slice of R Markdown.  When you are ready to explore more, go to [the R Markdown Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

## Get the templates

In RStudio, navigate to your 'RWorkflow' folder.  Click 'More' in the Files panel and select 'Set as working directory'.  Issue these commands or use the alternate methods in [Set-up](set-up.html).

```
library(RWorkflowsetup)
download.repo("Rmarkdown-Tutorial")
```

#### Add your new Project to your GitHub account (optional)

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Click File > Add Local Repository
3. Navigate to the folder `Rmarkdown-Tutorial` and click Add Repository
4. Now you should see 'Publish Repository' in GitHub Desktop.  Uncheck the 'keep code private box' and then click 'Publish'.  Note, it can take a moment to work.


## Basic Rmd file

Open up `Basic.Rmd`.  

At the top you see

```

```

This is the `yaml` which gives the instructions about how to process your R Markdown file.  The `yaml` file is sensitive to spaces.  Do not add or subtract spaces.  This `yaml` is very simple, but the `yaml` can be complex for some applications.  We will only be working with simple examples.

After the `yaml` is the content.  To see a summary of R Markdown formating, click 'Help' menu and then 'Markdown Quick Reference'.

## Create output

We can create documents in different formats from this Rmd file.  Click the drop-down menu next to the 'knit' button.

* **HTML** Select 'knit to HTML' to create a web document.
* **Word** Select 'knit to Word' to create a Word document.
* **PDF** Select 'knit to PDF' to create a PDF.

## Put your report online

#### RPubs

After knitting your Rmd file, a Preview will appear.  Click the 'Publish' button in the top right, select 'RPubs'.  This is a free service for publishing output.  Follow the instructions and you'll soon have a link you can share.

#### GitHub

If you have made your folder a Git repository, you can upload you html file to GitHub and share a link.  We will cover that when we talk about websites on GitHub.
